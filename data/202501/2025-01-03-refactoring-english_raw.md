Effective Writing for Software Developers

Many software developers think they’re naturally poor writers, but there’s no such thing.

Most software developers are weak writers because they don’t _try_.

You can improve your writing skills the same way you learned to become a better programmer: by learning best practices and understanding how to apply them.
