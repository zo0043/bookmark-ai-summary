从五月初 Mr. Ranedeer 开源至今已四个月，我从一开始的依葫芦画瓢模仿，到效果不佳因地制宜调整，到迭代更好用的 code interpreter 方案，目前正在用 agent 思路将它和别的 prompt 组合使用。还在摸索中，先把感触最深的几条写出来和大家交流。

**经验 1：用对格式 AI 记忆力和稳定性就能大幅提升**
------------------------------

用过 Mr. Ranedeer 的人一定会对它的记性表示惊讶：prompt 本身已经超长了，还进行了那么多轮对话，怎么最开始的学习风格设置、前几轮对话选择的课程规划详情，都能记得很牢不会忘似的？它的稳定性也很惊人：一般说来 prompt 过长 LLM 就可能顾此失彼，对其中的一些细节视而不见，但 Mr. Ranedeer 的各种细节要求都有被 LLM 注意到。

我的理解——其中的奥秘在于 json 格式其实是把所有内容有层次结构地组织起来了。以下是五月初版本，为了方便截图我把部分节点折叠了起来。大家看到这个，有没有联想到思维导图？

![Image 1](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1rydviaTf7Z1D3e8eA3LtVCQz9UpPia5ux6DnF6QG1TYQg1Yp94m1S3ibQ/640?wx_fmt=png)

人类用思维导图可以很好地帮助记忆，因为它将线性的内容分门别类组织成树状结构，内容被分块且呈现关联，记忆负担就小了。json 格式用更清晰的方式给出了 prompt 的层次结构，可以猜测相当于用思维导图的方式让 LLM 更容易记忆要点了。

不过这里的“记性好”仅指在 GPT4 的聊天界面对话，直接通过 API 调用的方式不太适用，对话轮次多了就直接返回 token 超限错误。我猜测也许 openai 的聊天窗口，有让 GPT 时不时对之前对话内容做总结之类的动作，而 json/yaml 的形式，恰好很合 GPT 做总结的胃口，能让它迅速抓住重点。

稳定性提升，则不管是在 openai 的聊天窗口聊还是 API 调用，都表现优秀。同样很容易理解：所有的要点都被用 json 各层级的 key 给 highlight 了，LLM 只要在思维导图上按图索骥就好，遵循的难度大幅降低。

五月的版本除了 json 还提供了 yaml 和 markdown 格式的。yaml 格式的 prompt 同样起到了将命令以树状结构组织的效果，但更省 token，对于两三层的不太复杂的 prompt 是够用的。markdown 更更省 token，但光靠 # ##  来区分层级不够明显，我测试下来只能稳定对付一层结构，也即将内容简单分块，如果要多层就效果不佳了。

**避坑 1****：****严谨的 json 表达会让 GPT 丢失一些创造力**
------------------------------------------

json 格式的 prompt 记性好稳定性强，但也有个大缺点：丢失创造力。五月我兴致勃勃把从 Mr. Ranedeer 学到的 json 招数用在一个 api 调用 prompt 的程序里，终于解决了返回内容和格式不稳定的问题。但是，高兴了没几个小时我就发现：GPT 回复的内容中规中矩了很多，就像把 temperature 调低了一样。

用人类的视角去想其实这不难理解：当你用一种逻辑极其清晰、表述规整严肃的方式给出指令，对方就应该用同样的态度来回复你，天马行空的创意发挥空间就小了。

对于需要严谨的任务来说这不是什么问题，但当时我写的是一个需要创意的程序。于是我去除了一些不太必要的复杂结构，用 yaml 代替 json（yaml 看起来比 json 轻松一点儿），故意用不太严谨的随意语调表述部分子任务后，效果得到了一些改进。

顺带提一句：“故意用不太严谨的随意语调表述部分子任务”这招是好几个月前朋友 Arrow 教我的。他发现如果 prompt 里加一些口头禅，就会给 AI 赋予一点儿灵魂，然后 AI 说的话就很自然。

不过这样的改进也还是有限。如果需要特别活泼跳脱的回复，或者指令就是特别复杂难以简化时，更好的方法是新起一个 thread，用普通聊天方式给出子任务，并将回复复制回原来的 json/yaml 格式的复杂 thread。把这样的方法写成自动化程序，就是 ai agents 相互协作了。

**经验 2：对 AI 编程只需伪到极致的伪代码**
--------------------------

五月时我看得最目瞪口呆的部分是最后一行 init 指令。仅仅因为命名为 init （给非程序员读者：initialize，初始化函数的常用名字），GPT 就知道要先执行这一行。随意地用了几个加号，GPT 就严格照办，甚至知道用 👋  来活跃气氛。

![Image 2](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1YtPf6FLiauicqGad8D1ujxLtSgf6aHwicxldC2s3FSEdCTibz1drOP6Zgg/640?wx_fmt=png)

换成中文后效果一样：

![Image 3](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1b3wXhBLt8SMsecEfbdqnicFEvF6M5L6QeicibnXIcst0uwCR3FGnbLelg/640?wx_fmt=png)

如果用程序语言来理解，很显然 init 是一个函数，version 和 author 都是在 prompt 最开头就定义好的“常量”。

![Image 4](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1yz70CXhwYrYmb2uGFtZauklhic3sCYagWV4nNYLp9icvrBlAiaCETicGsQ/640?wx_fmt=png)

但是，整段 prompt 没有告诉函数定义的格式是 <函数名\>:<函数体\>，+ 表示几个命令顺次执行，LLM 却无师自通了，且知道在代码运行的最开始应该调用 init。

我尝试换了几种不同的方式，都能很好地“执行函数”。

![Image 5](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1ryicnObStPE6JEKSWZzvgnJwzG2qnqwOibYLZl0ibQFWBFubFTTlAH24w/640?wx_fmt=png)

![Image 6](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_jpg/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1mygn4E8gwh1ZntILrw4uhjUzMELoicRFcQbty9OwsulWXVIwlfee0eA/640?wx_fmt=jpeg)

![Image 7](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_jpg/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1TDhTph4UiaNenFSrL8lakjac5BsHKYohphMqFZGCFWCicia6bEzvuAXSQ/640?wx_fmt=jpeg)

在看到 Mr. Ranedeer 前，为了让 GPT 能执行一些复杂逻辑，我经常会写些包含伪代码的 prompt，其中的伪代码还挺像真的，GPT 确实也能处理得很好。例如：

![Image 8](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1Lgh9kEyiaKKngjsRvKQREcFl1dbd7x4XiahEpCdWGNXia2ticQuhRTESFg/640?wx_fmt=png)

我给朋友炫技时遭到批评，说走在自然语言编程的路上，却把代码引入到 prompt 里，背道而驰似乎不太对。虽然朋友也承认引入代码后的精确控制能力超强，比啰哩啰嗦一大段文字说明要节约 token 得多。

但很显然，伪代码可以更随意，随意到函数调用和参数完全融在自然语言中。在看了 Mr. Ranedeer 后，我改写成下面的样子：

![Image 9](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1aWSjV3REYb4qvrbXH3gZYSEj5AB08ibBU7H15BFMsnxZayWo6RosEaA/640?wx_fmt=png)

当然，按照真正代码的格式来写，还是有助于提升稳定性的。太自然语言了，有时候 AI 会分不清到底应该说话还是“执行函数”。最新版的 Mr. Ranedeer 就用了格式非常清晰的伪代码。只不过，如果没有复杂到这个份上就还真用不着那么认真，且灵活自然的调用也有其强大之处。（挖坑，后面有机会写文章再展开。）
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**经验 3：用 code interpreter 的内存大幅增强 AI 的记忆力**
-------------------------------------------

  
每隔个把月我就会去看一下这个 17 岁少年有没有又折腾出什么新玩意儿。上个月，我发现他把 code interpreter 集成进了 Mr. Ranedeer，体现的正是我在[GPT 上神器 Code Interpreter 的三大超级特性](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4MjM5MDI0Ng==&mid=2648505441&idx=1&sn=2419ea94abd79eebad1eb07c2ab742d5&chksm=87ae21e8b0d9a8fe977fab537235dbf2699a74a6b483354e33cbbf27b55af52aa832048f8aae&scene=21#wechat_redirect) 里提到的第三个特性：用代码运行环境的内存增强 AI 的记忆里。
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

经验 1 虽然已经加强了记忆力，但毕竟有限，学习内容复杂了就有点 hold 不住。有了 code interpreter，至少几十兆内存，能保存上百万汉字呢。

方法很简单，需要保存信息的时候用打开 code interpreter 让保存，例如下面这段是在生成课程纲要后让  code interpreter 把它保存到 a.txt 文件里。

![Image 10](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1vkM6A2AOKUTakwTFfhUHImqEqOTXcHjAP5L9gB5X5IB0WYpMwT9Tqg/640?wx_fmt=png)

需要提取信息的时候也打开 code interpreter，从保存的文件里读取信息，再执行后续任务。比如这里正式上课前，就先去读一下学生的偏好设置、课程大纲以及接下来要教哪一课了。

![Image 11](https://mmbiz.qpic.cn/sz_mmbiz_png/sLRSg8JfIeZibC3iauuVPr4X9KZnNX1DA1buQwc6icZb7wiaYFfj9TvGnyXrJez02Ghaq8FYtVzMIFUOrdoSyIiaATg/640?wx_fmt=png)

我看到这个的第一反应是：这个少年真能折腾，相比之下我动作太慢啦。五月初我刚用上 code interpreter 时就[玩过利用内存的把戏](http://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=MzA4MjM5MDI0Ng==&mid=2648505092&idx=1&sn=8684dd39bd3bb51ee159a35a7253c1bc&chksm=87ae268db0d9af9bee9d7e5b04ed564b1f63ac23871cda255d8a55cf992bb2a1ac6920bed9af&scene=21#wechat_redirect)，但后来也没在真刀实枪的需求上用过。

不能输给少年呀。于是前阵子旅行途中我给自己打造了一个能陪我好奇探索的旅伴，就用 code interpreter 让旅伴长记性。比起单纯的文本，我用类似 excel 表格的 dataframe， 功能更强大。

初始任务是这样的：

AI 会初始化数据

然后每一轮交流后，AI 都会自动把对话内容存到表格里。

用 dataframe 表格的优势在于：后续我可以让 GPT 读取不同字段的内容，来执行各种不同操作。

例如让 AI 帮我回顾特定内容，它选择的是先搜索标签：

想要让 AI 总结特定地点的亮点，或者给出我们关于某一个话题的详细讨论内容，它都可以搞定。

这下真的再也不担心 AI 失忆了。（只不过 code interpreter 的 thread 如果长时间没交互会被回收掉，考虑自己写个 chrome 插件或者用 api 来搞定。这是个能写好几篇文章的话题，也先挖着待填。）

**避坑 2：专业领域的 know how 比 prompt 技巧更重要**
--------------------------------------

  
Mr. Ranedeer 虽惊艳，但我其实除了学习它的技巧，并没有真的在用这个 AI 导师学知识。我曾把它推荐给多个老师，大家的惊叹之后也没有后文。很可能的原因是它只是形似一个好老师，但在任务执行的细节上离好老师差距还太远。
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

它用三千多个字符给出了一个课程示例，这是 prompt 最大的败笔：这个示例的拆解知识点的方案未必适用于其它学科或知识点，教学课程设计更不只是 先修课程+主要课程 两部分。这就是 promot 中浪费 token 还起副作用的示例部分：

关于 promot，我最强的感受就是：专业领域经验，才是发挥 AI 威力让 AI 能更好地和人协作的关键。prompt 技巧能保证 AI 回复质量的下限，也能让使用 AI 的效率更高，但让 AI 回复的上限，除了模型本身的能力，就要靠提问者的 konw how 了。

当然，作为一个老师需要有怎样的 know how、prompt 里的 CoT 和示例应该怎么写，是另一个超级大话题，挖了坑等以后的文章再填吧。

后记：快有两个月没写公众号。五月初我拿到 plugin 权限，很长一段时间里，我想不出用它开发什么为好。AI 确实有帮我大幅提升代码效率，但在完成了两个别人的项目后，我竟然不知道接下来自己想做些什么。似乎有很多的“可以用 AI 来做这个做那个”的点子，但却都不是给自己用的，不是自己真正需要的。这种“我失去了创造自己需要的东西的欲望”的感受让人很难受。刚陪女儿在云南半工作半旅行地住了两周，点子一个接一个地冒出来，够我忙很久，也能引出很多文章主题了。看来还是得多留点时间给物理世界去感受真实的需求呀。
