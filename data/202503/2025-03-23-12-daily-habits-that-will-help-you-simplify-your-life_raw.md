Do you find it challenging to maintain daily habits? If your answer is yes, you’re not alone. I struggle with this, too. For example, simplifying my life posed unique challenges, especially when incorporating new daily habits like tracking expenses, avoiding shopping for fun, quitting social media, and more.

I’ve found author and researcher [Katy Milkman’s](https://www.katymilkman.com/) writing helpful. She studies habits and how to make better choices. Last year, Milkman shared some of her research with [NPR’s Life Kit](https://www.npr.org/2021/05/14/996939779/a-behavioral-scientists-advice-for-changing-your-life). In the interview, Milkman explained that there isn’t a quick fix to changing daily habits. For example, it took me years – not 30 days – to simplify my life. That isn’t a bad thing, though. Milkman noted that changing habits takes time and a consistent routine.

Below are 12 daily habits that helped me simplify my life. The list below isn’t exhaustive, and it’s meant to be a jumping off point. I’d also encourage you to choose one or two items on the list to add to your daily routine.

### 1\. Take a tiny walk after a meal 

Rather than sitting on the couch after I eat a meal, I’ve been going for a 2 to 5 minute walk. Rachel Fairbank, a journalist with The New York Times, inspired this tiny habit. In her article, Fairbank [shared the findings](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/08/04/well/move/walking-after-eating-blood-sugar.html?mwgrp=c-dbar&unlocked_article_code=1.JE0.nxln.9d0fzld-8o3q&smid=url-share) (NYT gift link) of a meta-analysis that “compared the effects of sitting versus standing or walking on measures of heart health, including insulin and blood sugar levels.” Researchers discovered that very tiny walks – between two and five minutes – “had a significant impact in moderating blood sugar levels.”

### 2\. Track your income and expenses

If you’re new to tracking your income and expenses, you can use an app, a pen and journal, or a basic spreadsheet. For example, I take time daily to record my income and expenses. I’d encourage you to do the same. Over time, you’ll notice patterns and trends that you can change. If you want to [declutter your finances](https://bemorewithless.com/simple-budget/) over the long-run, this is a great first step.

### 3\. Use what you have

Before you buy something new, use what you have. For instance, if you’re trying to save money on groceries, cook the bulk food that is already in your pantry or refrigerator. Alternatively, if you want to buy a new sweater, inventory what’s in your closet. Ask yourself: Do I wear what I already have?

### 4\. Declutter in bursts

“A decluttering challenge can make the sometimes mundane process of decluttering a little more fun,” says [Courtney Carver](https://bemorewithless.com/decluttering-burst/). I agree! It’s been fun to do decluttering challenges and experiments – like Courtney’s – over the years. If you’re struggling, try Courtney’s challenge and “[let go of one hundred things in less than an hour](https://bemorewithless.com/decluttering-burst/).” Using challenges like the decluttering burst or the [10-10-100 decluttering challenge](https://bemorewithless.com/anti-procrastinate/) can help add some fun to your daily habits.

### 5\. Limit technology use

Limiting technology use has helped me [get off my phone and into my life](https://bemorewithless.com/get-off-your-phone/). I still fall back into bad habits – like doom scrolling – but I’m able to course correct more quickly now. Setting myself up for success is key. For example, I create phone free zones in my home, take movement breaks during my work day, turn off my phone, and more. Our phones – and other devices – aren’t going anywhere, so consider how you can create healthy habits around technology.

### 6\. Simplify your wardrobe

My wardrobe is small and I love it! However, keeping my wardrobe streamlined and [simplified](https://bemorewithless.com/project-333/) is an ongoing process. For example, I recently [donated clothes](https://bemorewithless.com/where-to-donate-stuff/) to my local thrift store. The clothes were in great condition, but they didn’t fit my body anymore; some items were too big and others were too tight. I don’t try to fit my body into clothes anymore. If they don’t feel right, I let them go. This keeps my wardrobe light and lovely.

### 7\. Don’t go shopping.

Avoid recreational shopping. Instead, make a “to buy” list. Then wait for 30 days before you purchase the thing you wanted to buy. For example, I have t-shirts, dresses, and a typewriter on my “to-buy” list. After waiting for 30-days, I didn’t buy any of the items. Instead, I saved my money.

### 8\. Try a low cost hobby  

A few months ago, I wrote about [eco-friendly tips for everyday life](https://bemorewithless.com/sustainable-living/). One of my favorite tips was focused on [sashiko](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2019/3/25/18274743/visible-mending-sashiko-mending-fast-fashion-movement); the Japanese art of visible mending. I love how this art form is a visible antidote to [fast fashion](https://bookriot.com/books-about-fast-fashion/). Repairing your clothes can be a rewarding process, and it is “[the perfect simple, low-cost hobby to get you off your phone](https://slate.com/human-interest/2019/07/sashiko-perfect-cheap-hobby-break-phone-addiction.html).”

### 9\. Practice gratitude  

In my early twenties, I tended to compare my life to my peers. I thought that prettier jewelry, a luxury car, or a bigger house would make me happier. However, I discovered that isn’t true. A daily practice of writing a short gratitude list in my journal helped me simplify my life and stay rooted in the present. I don’t need a fancy car or a [big house](https://tstrobel.com/our-tiny-house/) to be happy. My gratitude practice helped me figure out what was enough, and that is an excellent antidote to [the comparison trap](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/201711/the-comparison-trap).

### 10\. Create a list of simple pleasures  

Savoring [simple pleasures](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/164-simple-pleasures-mostly-inexpensive-things-you/id1489742667?i=1000613968375) is a joyful habit. I love making coffee in the morning, journaling, snuggling with my cat, and giving my husband a hug. These pleasures are ingrained into my daily routine, are focused on experiences (not things), and they cost little to no money. What simple pleasures bring joy, delight, and gratitude into your life? If you’re looking for ideas, check out my [big list of simple pleasures](https://bemorewithless.com/simple-pleasures/).

If you’re having trouble sticking with new daily habits, find community. You could [Join The Simplicity Space](https://courses.bemorewithless.com/the-simplicity-space/) or ask a friend to be your “simplicity buddy.” It’s way more fun to change habits with friends. The support and accountability you’ll receive is invaluable.

### 12\. Limit your news consumption

Reducing stress is a big part of simplifying your life and consuming too much news, especially “breaking news” is stressful. Instead, put boundaries around your news consumption. Don’t consume news at the beginning or end of your day for instance. If you are feeling overwhelmed with the news, take a break and read some of these [uplifting books](https://bemorewithless.com/8-uplifting-books/) instead.
